FAQ Chatbot for E-commerce Website
Project Overview
This FAQ chatbot is designed to automate the process of answering frequently asked questions on an e-commerce website, offering quick, accurate, and helpful responses to customers. The chatbot is integrated with a simple and easy-to-use web interface, providing 24/7 support for users visiting the website, improving customer experience and reducing the burden on customer service teams.

Features
Automated FAQ Responses: Provides instant answers to common questions like shipping, return policies, and product details.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot uses pre-trained NLP models to understand user queries even if they are phrased differently than the FAQs.
Web Interface: A chat interface that is simple to interact with, allowing users to type questions and receive answers in real time.
Dynamic Content: The system allows for easy updates to the FAQ database, ensuring the chatbot answers questions based on the most current information.
Fallback Mechanism: In case the chatbot cannot answer a question, it provides a default response or suggests contacting customer support.
Technologies Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
transformers library for pre-trained models like BERT or GPT for understanding and responding to user input.
nltk for text processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
Backend Framework:
Flask or FastAPI for creating the RESTful API that handles chatbot logic.
Frontend Technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the web interface.
Optionally, React for building a dynamic chat interface.
Database (optional):
Use of a simple database like SQLite, MySQL, or NoSQL database for storing FAQs and user interaction logs.
Deployment:
Deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or a similar cloud service for easy access and scalability.
Functionality
User Query Input: Users can type questions into the chatbot interface.
Response Generation: The chatbot uses an NLP model to process the question and return an appropriate answer from the FAQ database.
Error Handling: If the chatbot cannot provide a response, it suggests possible next steps, such as checking the FAQ page or contacting customer support.
Updates and Maintenance: The FAQ content can be easily modified by updating the database, which ensures the chatbot provides up-to-date information.
